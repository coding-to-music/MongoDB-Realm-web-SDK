Realm App Hosting: cannot upload files, incorrect directory, files not found

Hello
I am doing this tutorial

https://www.mongodb.com/developer/quickstart/realm-web-sdk/

Here is my repo

https://github.com/coding-to-music/MongoDB-Realm-web-SDK

When I push on my repo it is deployed, however it is not deploying the index.html and data.js in the root directory.

I am unable to manually upload the two files because the Upload button is grayed out and some error messages are displayed, as seen in this image:

![image|600x500](upload://tYlyyQr0vvLWwXA7oQ5IGbr9oUx.png)

I can view the files are working correctly (querying Atlas) using Live Server, however the files are not picked up by the Realm dashboard and are not deployed to the URL
